/*! \brief Displays player health in a box for the main player 
 * 
 * UIComponent is drawn on top of everything else in the scene.
 * The health uses glyphs from a text file to look identical to
 * the source material. The glyphs use the green or orange rows
 * when the player is healing or taking damage respectively.
 * 
 * When player health drops low, a beep plays with HIGH priority
 * 
 * When the battle is over, the BattleOverTrigger is activated
 * and sets the internal flag to false which stops beeping
